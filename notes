  //Extract the public ID from the existing avatar URL
  const publicId = userAvtarDelete.avatar.split('/').pop().split('.')[0];

 user.avatar.split('/') splits the URL by each /, turning it into an array of strings.
 .pop() takes the last element from this array, which is the part after the last /. This would be something like ih49rjmyfp6bcjcsfd.jpg from your URL.
 .split('.')[0] then splits that string by . and takes the first part, which gives you the public ID, in this case, ih49rjmyfp6bcjcsfd.
